# log4j2-elasticsearch-core
Core provides a skeleton for `ClientObjectFactory` implementations: a set of interfaces and base classes to push logs in batches to Elasticsearch cluster. By default, FasterXML is used generate output via `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.layout.JsonLayout`.

### Maven

To use it, add this XML snippet to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.appenders.log4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>log4j2-elasticsearch-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

However, direct use of this library is required only in case of Log4j2 configuration with Java API or user-provided extensions. This library is in `compile` scope for `jest` and `bulkprocessor` implementations.

## Extensibility

Main parts of the skeleton are:
* `ClientObjectFactory` - provider of client-specific request classes, factories and error handlers
* `BatchEmitter` - intermediate log collector which will trigger batch delivery as configured (see below).

### AsyncBatchDelivery

`AsyncBatchDelivery` uses `ClientObjectFactory` objects to produce client specific requests and deliver them to cluster via `BatchEmitter` implementations.

### BatchEmitter

`BatchEmitterFactory<T extends BatchEmitter>` implementations are located using `java.util.ServiceLoader`. `org.appenders.log4j2.elasticsearch.BulkEmitter` is the current default implementation.

## Configurability

### Delivery frequency
Delivery frequency can be adjusted via `AsyncBatchDelivery` attributes:
* `deliveryInterval` - millis between deliveries
* `batchSize` - maximum (rough) number of logs in one batch

Delivery is triggered each `deliveryInterval` or when number of undelivered logs reached `batchSize`.

`deliveryInterval` is the main driver of delivery. However, in high load scenarios, both parameters should be configured accordingly to prevent sub-optimal behaviour. See [Indexing performance tips](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/indexing-performance.html) and [Performance Considerations](https://www.elastic.co/blog/performance-considerations-elasticsearch-indexing) for more info.

### Index name
Since 1.1, index name can be defined using `IndexName` tag:

```xml
<Appenders>
    <Elasticsearch name="elasticsearchAsyncBatch">
        ...
        <IndexName indexName="log4j2" />
        ...
    </Elasticsearch>
</Appenders>
```

### Index rollover
Since 1.1, rolling index can be defined using `RollingIndexName` tag:

```xml
<Appenders>
    <Elasticsearch name="elasticsearchAsyncBatch">
        ...
        <!-- zone is optional. OS timezone is used by default -->
        <RollingIndexName indexName="log4j2" pattern="yyyy-MM-dd" timeZone="Europe/Warsaw" />
        ...
    </Elasticsearch>
</Appenders>
```

`pattern` accepts any valid date pattern with years down to millis (although rolling daily or weekly should be sufficient for most use cases)
`IndexName` and `RollingIndexName` are mutually exclusive. Only one per appender should be defined, otherwise they'll override each other.

### Index template
Since 1.1, [Index templates](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.0/indices-templates.html) can be created during appender startup. Template can be loaded from specified file or defined directly in the XML config:

```xml
<Appenders>
    <Elasticsearch name="elasticsearchAsyncBatch">
        ...
        <AsyncBatchDelivery>
            <IndexTemplate name="template1" path="<absolute_path_or_classpath>" />
            ...
        </AsyncBatchDelivery>
        ...
    </Elasticsearch>
</Appenders>
```
or
```xml
<Appenders>
    <Elasticsearch name="elasticsearchAsyncBatch">
        ...
        <AsyncBatchDelivery>
            <IndexTemplate name="template1" >
            {
                // your index template in JSON format
            }
            </IndexTemplate>
            ...
        </AsyncBatchDelivery>
        ...
    </Elasticsearch>
</Appenders>
```

NOTE: Be aware that template parsing errors on cluster side DO NOT prevent plugin from loading - error is logged on client side and startup continues.

### Message output
There are at least three ways to generate output
* (default) JsonLayout will serialize LogEvent using Jackson mapper configured in log4j-core
* `messageOnly="true"` can be configured set to make use of user provided (or default) `org.apache.logging.log4j.message.Message.getFormattedMessage()` implementation
* custom `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.layout.AbstractStringLayout` can be provided to appender config to use any other serialization mechanism

### Failover
Each unsuccessful batch can be redirected to any given `FailoverPolicy` implementation. By default, each log entry will be separately delivered to configured strategy class, but this behaviour can be amended by providing custom `ClientObjectFactory` implementation.

## Dependencies

Be aware that Jackson FasterXML jars that has to be provided by user for this library to work in default mode.
See `pom.xml` or deps summary at [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.appenders.log4j/log4j2-elasticsearch-core/latest) for a list of dependencies.
